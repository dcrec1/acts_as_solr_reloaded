acts_as_solr comes with a quick and fast unit test suite, and with a longer-running
functional test suite, the latter testing the actual integration with Solr.

== Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install mongodb-server
bundle install

== Running test
To run the acts_as_solr's plugin tests run the following steps:

- RAILS_ENV=test rake solr:start

- rake test:unit
(or just rake test)

- rake test:functional (Accepts the following arguments: DB=sqlite|mysql and MYSQL_USER=user)

== Troubleshooting:
If for some reason the tests don't run and you get MySQL errors, make sure you edit the MYSQL_USER entry under
config/environment.rb. It's recommended to create or use a MySQL user with no password.
